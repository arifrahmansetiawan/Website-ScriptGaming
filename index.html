At the age of 9 I learned a lot of programming languages ​​such as Html, Css, JavaScript, and Php, I am interested in programming because I like seeing complicated letters that are difficult for me to learn and also beneficial to society</p>

                <p>
                    In Graphic Design I was assisted by someone, namely Daire Aufa, he helped me with visual elements, why did I use other people for Graphic design because... <a href="#more">Read More</a>

                <p>

        <h3>More For Graphic Design</h3>
        <p>because there is no way I can develop this website myself because, I have limited time to create visual elements, to develop designs on the web we must have communication with developers because this field must have strong communication. Graphic design itself is a communication process using visual elements , such as typography, photography, and illustrations which are intended to create a perception of a message being conveyed.</p>

        <h3>More For Web Development</h3>
        <p>Because in my opinion, if I use other people in developing web development, the results will not match my expectations. Apart from that reason, I also have other reasons for developing web development, namely, because I also want to hone my programming skills, because in my opinion if my programming skills are not sharpened then I will not have enough knowledge to face the future if I want to enter several IT fields/jobs, web development itself is also the process of building and maintaining a website. This process works behind the scenes to create an attractive and well-functioning website to improve user experience.</p>
